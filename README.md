# pyPodPro (Python iPod Pro)

## What is it?
My basic attempt to create a next-gen iPod through the use of a SBC crammed into an old iPod chassis.

## What will it do?
Hopefully...
- Play local media files (aka the bare minimum)
- Use a real iPod click wheel as an interface (perhaps with a taptic engine instead of the old clicker)
- Display everything on a transflective TFT LCD screen
- Wirelessly connect and stream/download from self-hosted media servers (like JellyFin)
- Support high-impedance headphones
- Support Bluetooth headphones
- Support expandable storage via MicroSD cards
- Charge and transfer data via USB-C
- Wirelessly charge (although probably not)

## How will you do this?
Great question ðŸ˜‰ For now, I'm planning on using:
- Python with tkinter for the UI
- Armbian for the OS
- PocketBeagle 2 or Raspberry Pi CM4 for the SBC
- Some kind of daughterboard/cape to enable networking, expandable storage, and basically everything else.

## When will it do all of that?
Likely a long time from now, this is just for my own education ðŸ˜Š

## How do I contribute?
```
git clone https://github.com/ntfrueh/pyPodPro.git
uv venv                      # Create virtual environment
uv run app/src/main.py       # Run the GUI program
```
